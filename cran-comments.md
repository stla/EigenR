The CRAN checks report an error on the Windows platform. I think this is a 
either a transient problem, or this is a problem which is fixed by the flags 
I added in the Makevars file.


## Test environments

* Windows 10, R-4.1.2
* win-builder (devel)
* Ubuntu 18, R-3.6.3
* Ubuntu 20 via Github action


## R CMD check results

OK
