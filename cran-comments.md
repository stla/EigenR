This is a resubmission. As shown on the CRAN results page, the installation 
failed on Windows 32 bits, it threw the error message "cc1plus.exe: out of memory". My C++ code was made of a unique file. I splitted it into numerous 
small files. I tested the 32 bits installation on my laptop, and it has been 
successful.
